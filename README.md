## ðŸ“‹ Example
> This example assumes you are running a Bash-like shell and have already organised your sample lines into a line separated `lines.txt` file.

```sh
# Store model for repeated use
$ markov analyse < ./lines.txt > ./model.json
$ markov generate < ./model.json

# As a one liner
$ cat ./lines.txt | markov analyse | markov generate
```
